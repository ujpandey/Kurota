A stalled attempt at an open source fantasy online roleplaying game. The name means "Fantasy" in Shona, one of the major languages from Zimbabwe.

This was just a little something I played around with a little over a year ago. Perhaps will get back to it someday.

The art is from [Liberated Pixel Cup](http://lpc.opengameart.org/) and is dual-licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 and GPLv3.

There are a couple of demos for networking with SDL_Net (I believe the only difference is SDL1.2 vs SDL2) inside the dump folder which might be the only thing valuable for someone else, and only if they are completely new to networking and want a visual demo. The SDL1.2 code relies on a minimal layer on top of SDL by Dr. Yihsiang Liow but it's in the folder so should build properly.
